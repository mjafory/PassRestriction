# Email Restriction for Password Reset Requests

## Description

This project aims to enhance the security and user experience of a password reset request form by restricting the entry of work email addresses, guiding users to use their personal email addresses instead. The JavaScript code detects work email domains and alerts users in real-time, providing a more user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Email Restriction:** The script identifies and restricts the entry of work email addresses (e.g., @workdomain.com) in the password reset form.

- **Alert System:** Users receive immediate alerts if they attempt to submit a work email address. The alerts encourage them to use a personal email for the password reset process.

- **Auto Correction:** The system automatically removes instances of the work email domain from the entered email address, assisting users in providing the correct information.
